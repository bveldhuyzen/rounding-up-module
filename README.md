# rounding-up-module
Rounds any number up to the nearest (multiple of) specified decimal(s).

Also available now as stand-alone version to apply rounding to lists. See rounding-up-module-for-lists folder. Rounds numbers from list up to the nearest (multiple of) specified decimal(s) as described for v1.01. See for example list.txt (original) and LIST_DATE_TEST_2.txt (rounded numbers). Currently accepts the following list format: one numerical value to round up per line; any amount of lines; dots as separator for integer and decimals.

v1.01
Calculates the nearest (multiple of) specified decimals with the integer as starting point (e.g. with rounding up set at 0.75, the number 1,55 will round up to 1.75)

v1.02
Calculates the nearest (multiple of) specified decimals with 0 (zero) as starting point (e.g. with rounding up set at 0.75, the number 1,55 will round up to 2,25)
